Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jiwon, a **software developer** and **AI engineer** specializing in **Computer Vision**. As a growth-driven developer, I enjoy pushing my limits and solving challenges - that's what makes this journey meaningful for me! I strive to think critically, clearly identify issues, and develop thoughtful solutions. I always keep a pen and a piece of paper nearbyâ€”they're my go-to tools for organizing, externalizing, and refining ideas.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been into optimizing AI models to fit project needs and deploying them on embedded systems. Iâ€™m especially interested in making Computer Vision models more lightweight through hands-on implementation and research.
